Applications:

* LPSolver (have yet to add to LaTeX doc)
  optimal maxmin/minmax strategies in basic two-player zero-sum games
  input m/n payoff matrix A, output optimal probability vector p
  p is a m or n dimensional tuple describing the percentage of games player 1 or 2 should take actions corresponding to p
  SPAM used for finding all such payoff matrices that would result in the same probability vector p
  * created a functional program P for solving concrete examples 
  * had difficulties understanding proof cell/complex due to list datatype returned by P
  * don't know how useful this program actually is in economics

* ineq2 (in LaTeX doc)
  given a set of inequalities from Cournot games (two-player duopolies investigating optimal levels of R&D), simplifies that set 
  in the d'Aspremont-Jacquemin case (from Adib) ineq2 "simplifies" the parameter conditions by reducing the number of high-degree inequalities
  does impose additional linear constraints for parameters that were previously unconstrained
  ** will apply to other two cases in the d'Aspremont-Jacquemin paper
  ** could be useful in simplifying different sets of inequalities

* portfolio2 (have yet to add to LaTeX doc)
  given lists of historical financial data, portfolio2 computes the optimal allocation of investment portfolio for a given parameter value of mu (risk)
  can be adjusted for any lists of historical data
  ** trying to optimize the interactivelp solver from Sage
  * use cProfile for execution time of program's components
  * right now parametric proof cell computation is very slow
  * computation on QQ valued arguments is fast
